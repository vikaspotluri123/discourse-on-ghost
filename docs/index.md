## Getting Started

_Feel like something's missing? [File an issue](https://github.com/vikaspotluri123/discourse-on-ghost/issues)!_

### Step 1: Pick your Path

Discourse on Ghost has 2 methods to authenticate users:

1. Secure (recommended): Mirrors the authentication that Ghost uses to authenticate members.
	- Requires DoG to sit on the same domain (not a subdomain) as your Ghost site
2. Obscure: Uses the user's email address and unique Ghost identifier to authenticate members.
	- Allows Discourse on Ghost to sit on any domain (including a subdomain)
	- Relies on [security through obscurity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity) (since it's relatively difficult, though not impossible, to guess both the unique identifier and email address of a member)

Both methods have the same installation instructions, but your configuration will be slightly different.

### Step 2: Install on your Server

A few things to note:
- DoG requires node.js (v16 LTS) and npm to be installed, which is compatible with Ghost.
- DoG will work on Debian-based Linux distributions, but support for other flavors or Operating Systems (such as Mac OS or Windows) is not guaranteed.

```bash
# Create the directory where DoG will live
mkdir discourse-on-ghost
cd discourse-on-ghost
# Install the DoG dependency
npm install @potluri/discourse-on-ghost
# Create the environment variables file
cp node_modules/@potluri/discourse-on-ghost/.env.example .env
# Create the entrypoint script
echo "import('@potluri/discourse-on-ghost/build/targets/node.js');" > index.js
```

### Step 3: Configure DoG

The `.env` file you created contains the information needed to make DoG run. Refer to the [configuration documentation](./configuration) for in-depth information about each variable.

Once you configure DoG, make sure all the Ghost Tiers are tracked as Discourse Groups. You should run this script whenever you change add/remove tiers.

```bash
node node_modules/@potluri/discourse-on-ghost/build/targets/first-run-node.js
```

### Step 4: Set up NGINX


#### For standalone installations (`obscure` mode)

_This section isn't well documented. PRs are welcome!_

You'll need to install NGINX with SSL (acme.sh is a good place to start), and configure it to serve traffic from your domain.

#### For existing Ghost installations (`secure` mode)

Modify the NGINX configuration that Ghost automatically created. You can find the file in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/your.domain-ssl.conf`.

Add the following before the last line (should be a `}`):

```nginx
location {SUB_DIR}/ghost/api/external_discourse_on_ghost {
	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
	proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
	proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
	proxy_set_header Host $host;
	proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:{PORT_NAME};
}
```

- Replace `{SUB_DIR}` with your Ghost subdirectory, if you have one. If you don't, just remove it.
- Replace `{PORT_NAME}` with the port that DoG will listen (DOG_PORT, defaults to 3286). Don't remove the `;` at the end!

Save the file, and run `sudo nginx -s reload` to get NGINX to safely pick up the changes.

<summary markdown="span">Example DoG + Ghost NGINX configuration</summary>

```nginx
server {
	listen 443 ssl http2;
	listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

	server_name example.com;
	root /var/www/ghost/system/nginx-root;

	ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/example.com/fullchain.cer;
	ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/example.com/example.com.key;
	include /var/www/ghost/system/files/ssl-params.conf;

	location / {
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:2369;
	}

	location /ghost/api/external_discourse_on_ghost {
		proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3286;
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
		proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
		proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
		proxy_set_header Host $http_host;
	}

	location ~ /.well-known {
		allow all;
	}

	client_max_body_size 50m;
}
```
</details>

### Step 5: Configure a process manager

Process managers are used to run an application in the background. They try to ensure that the application is running, even after crashing.

#### Systemd

Example service file (based on Ghost):
```systemd
[Unit]
Description=Discourse on Ghost
Documentation=https://github.vikaspotluri.me/discourse-on-ghost

[Service]
Type=simple
# Don't forget to update this!
WorkingDirectory=/path/to/discourse-on-ghost
# The user might be different for `obscure` mode
User=ghost
Environment="NODE_ENV=production"
# You can get your node path by running `which node`
ExecStart=/path/to/node index.js
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

1. Fill in the example, and save to `/lib/systemd/system/discourse_on_ghost.service`
1. run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`
1. run `sudo systemctl enable discourse_on_ghost.service`
1. run `sudo systemctl start discourse_on_ghost.service`
1. confirm you did everything correctly:
    - run `sudo systemctl status discourse_on_ghost.service`
    - The output should contain `Loaded: loaded`, and `Active: active (running)`

*[SSO]: Single Sign On
*[DoG]: Discourse on Ghost

### Step 6: Configure Discourse

_Note: You should already have created an API key for DoG in the configuration step_

Head to the *Login Settings* of your Discourse installation (`https://your.forum/admin/site_settings/category/login`)

Scroll to the option `enable discourse connect`

1. Before you can enable Discourse Connect (SSO), you need to specify the URL. Enter the Discourse Connect URL in the `discourse connect url` field
  - This will be `https://your.ghost.blog/subdir/ghost/api/external_discourse_on_ghost/sso`. `subdir` will be the path your blog is installed on - if you don't have a path, remove it from the url.
  - For `obscure` mode, you need to set up a landing page at `DOG_OBSCURE_GHOST_SSO_PAGE` as defined in the configuration
1. Check the `enable discourse connect` option (above `discourse connect url`)
1. Enter the `DOG_DISCOURSE_SHARED_SECRET` value from your configuration into `discourse connect secret`

Once you enable Discourse Connect, forum members will only be able to log in by being a member in Ghost. Forum admins can log in using a magic link via `https://your.forum/u/admin-login`

#### Allow longer usernames

Ghost's default tier names can get pretty long, and this can cause Discourse Groups to fail being created. You might want to increase the `max username length` setting to 30 since username and group lengths are both controlled by this. Here's a [Discourse discussion for reference](https://meta.discourse.org/t/group-name-character-limitation/31229)

#### Add private categories

DoG syncs your member's tiers with a corresponding Discourse group, which means you can use Discourse's [Private Categories](https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-to-create-private-categories-using-category-permission-security-settings/87678) feature to create gated sections of the forum for commenting or conversation.

#### A note on using Discourse for comments on Ghost

It's possible to [use Discourse for comments on your Ghost publication](https://ghost.org/integrations/discourse/).
However, Discourse's embed feature doesn't allow dynamically setting the category.
This can be an issue if e.g. you're looking to create gated content sections in your forum.

To work around this limitation:

 - After publishing your post, head over to the comments section on the live post
 - Click `Continue Discussion` to open the auto-generated thread
 - Set the topic's category to the private category associated with the tier

Alternatively, since Discourse allows you to specify the category based on the URL, you can also use Ghost's [Dynamic Routing](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/routing/) feature to create a "subdirectory" for each tier.


### Step 7: Configure Ghost Webhooks

Head to the *Integrations* page of your Ghost installation (`https://your.blog/ghost/#/settings/integrations/`)

Go to your DoG integration (should have been created in the configuration step)

Scroll to the `Webhooks` section

Add your `Member Updated` Webhook
- Name can be whatever you want!
- Event should be `Member Updated`
- Target URL should be `https://your.blog/ghost/api/external_discourse_on_ghost/DOG_GHOST_MEMBER_UPDATED_WEBHOOK_ID` (replace `DOG_GHOST_MEMBER_UPDATED_WEBHOOK_ID` with the config value)

Add your `Member Deleted` Webhook
- Name can be whatever you want!
- Event should be `Member Deleted`
- Target URL should be `https://your.blog/ghost/api/external_discourse_on_ghost/DOG_GHOST_MEMBER_DELETED_WEBHOOK_ID` (replace `DOG_GHOST_MEMBER_DELETED_WEBHOOK_ID` with the config value)

### Step 8: You're done!

It might have been a journey, but you made it ðŸŽ‰ Test out Discourse SSO, and member tier sync, it should work now!


## Upgrading

To update your DoG instance:

1. Determine if there's a new release by viewing the [Releases page](https://github.com/vikaspotluri123/discourse-on-ghost/releases) on GitHub
1. Review the changes. Just like after a flight, please use caution when opening overhead bins, as feature changes and deprecations might smack you in the face.
1. Make sure you're in the installation directory - `cd /path/to/discourse-on-ghost`
1. Update the module - `npm update`
1. Make any required config changes based on the release notes
1. Restart the process. If you're using systemd, run `sudo systemctl restart discourse_on_ghost.service`
